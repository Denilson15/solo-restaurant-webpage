# Solo Restaurant Webpage

This is a custom-built restaurant landing page developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice responsive layout and frontend development skills.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://restaurant-mock-webpage.netlify.app/](https://restaurant-mock-webpage.netlify.app/)

This project showcases a clean, mobile-first design suitable for a restaurant's online presence. It includes:

- A hero section with a featured dish and call-to-action
- A responsive menu layout displaying various food items
- Interactive elements for user engagement

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Menu data is stored in a separate `data.js` file as an array of objects.
- JavaScript reads the data and generates menu cards dynamically.
- Layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design across sections.
- Interactive elements like category filters can be added in future versions.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Original HTML structure and CSS styling
- Custom layout using Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness
- JavaScript enhancements for interactivity

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Expand layout for better desktop responsiveness
- Add animations or hover effects for improved user experience
- Explore performance optimizations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure
- `index.css` – Custom styles and layout
- `index.js` – JavaScript for interactivity
- `data.js` – Data for menu items
- `vite.config.js` – Configuration for Vite
